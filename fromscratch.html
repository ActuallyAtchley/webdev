            About the BYU Solar Decathlon
        </h1>

        <p>
            The BYU Solar Decathlon Team is unique in that they are involved in not one, but two different competitions. 
        </p>
            <ol>
                <li>US Department of Energy Solar Decathlon</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>2022 Design Challenge</li>
                        <li>2023 Build Challenge</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Orange County Sustainability Decathlon</li>
            </ol>
        <p>
            In 2022 the team participated in the US Department of Energy Build Challenge. The team is now building that design for the 2023 Build Challenge. In addition, the house will be transported in the Fall of 2023 to southern California for the Orange County Sustainability Decathlon. A description of the two different competitions and links to their respective websites are included below.
        </p>
        <h2>US Department of Energy Solar Decathlon</h2>

        <p>
            NREL organizes the U.S. Department of Energy Solar Decathlon, a program that offers collegiate teams a unique experience for developing critical career skills, learning from experts and peers, and gaining valuable insights from world-class thought leaders.

            Solar Decathlon provides participating students with hands-on experience and unique training that prepares them to enter the clean energy workforce.

       <p>   
        The Solar Decathlon competition is composed of two Challenges: the Design Challenge and the Build Challenge. </p> 
       <p>    
        Teams that compete in the annual Design Challenge create residential or commercial building designs that are evaluated on how well they meet the nation's rapidly evolving demand for innovative, quick-to-build, high-quality, resilient, grid-interconnected, efficient buildings that respond to targeted community needs.
       </p>

        <p>
            Teams that compete in the biennial Build Challenge design and construct full-functional houses in one of two Divisions: the National Showcase Division or the Local Build Division. In the National Showcase Division, teams will ship their houses to the Smithsonian Folklife Festival in June 2020 for display on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. In the Local Build Division, teams will display their built houses in selected local communities. Two winners—one from each division—will be selected in July 2020.

        <h2>Orange County Sustainability Decathlon</h2>

        <p>
            The Orange County Sustainability Decathlon challenges university teams to design and build model solar-powered homes that address climate change and California’s housing needs. OCSD23 teams will showcase innovative, market-ready model homes to display in a sustainable village which will be open to the public.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Orange County Sustainability Decathlon will take place October 5-15, 2023, at the OC Fair and Event Center in Costa Mesa, CA. The event will feature the OCSD23 competition, as well as an expo with a variety of vendors, activities, and entertainment.
